This is my take on SlimROM6 modding
=============================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/TBoneWiz/platform_manifest.git -b mm6.0


Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync


I have a lot to learn - please don't judge me...
